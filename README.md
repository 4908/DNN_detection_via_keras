# DNN_detection_via_keras
the implementation of **Power of Deep Learning for Channel Estimation and Signal Detection** in OFDM Systems using keras

# Requirement
tensorflow-gpu >= 1.12.0

# data sets
I have uploaded the required data sets in [BaiduYun Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/16_hVoPErs4dV3LXtwPU-4w)

password: **1234**

which are generated by saving the numpy arrays loaded from original provided .txt files.

Then, directly move the channel_train.npy and channel_test.npy to current file. Namely, the paths are 
'./channel_train.npy' and './channel_test.npy'.

# How to use
After downloaded and moved the data sets, just run main.py directly.
